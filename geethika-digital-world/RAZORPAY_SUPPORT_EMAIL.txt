Subject: UPI Payment Method Not Showing in Checkout - Urgent

Dear Razorpay Support Team,

I am writing regarding an issue with UPI payment method not appearing in the checkout flow for my customers.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Business Name: Geethika Digital World
- Key ID: rzp_live_SCXkFazIA5jEk0
- Mode: Live
- Website: https://geethika-digital-world.vercel.app

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
UPI is showing as "ACTIVATED" in my Razorpay Dashboard (Account & Settings > UPI/QR), but it is NOT appearing in the checkout modal for customers. Only Cards, Netbanking, and Wallet options are visible.

WHAT I'VE CHECKED:
✓ UPI shows as ACTIVATED in dashboard
✓ UPI Autopay shows as ACTIVATED in dashboard
✓ Tested with multiple amounts (₹1, ₹151, etc.)
✓ Cleared browser cache and tested in incognito mode
✓ Tested on different browsers
✓ Code integration is correct (no method restrictions)
✓ Using live Razorpay keys

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Customers should see UPI as a payment option with ability to:
- Pay with UPI ID
- Scan QR Code
- Use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
Only Cards, Netbanking, and Wallet options appear. No UPI option visible.

SCREENSHOTS:
[Attach screenshots showing:
1. Dashboard with UPI ACTIVATED
2. Checkout modal without UPI option]

REQUEST:
Please investigate why UPI is not appearing in the checkout flow despite being activated, and enable it for my account.

This is affecting our business as many customers prefer UPI payments.

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Best regards,
Geethika Digital World
